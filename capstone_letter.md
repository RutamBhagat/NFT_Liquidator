## Liquidating an NFT to Any Token: A Chrome Extension for Tensor.trade

### Problem

The Solana NFT ecosystem primarily operates with SOL as the trading token. However, many traders and collectors prefer using stablecoins like USDC and USDT due to their price stability and ease of use. This preference creates a gap in the market, as users often face challenges when trying to liquidate their NFTs directly into their preferred tokens without significant friction.

### Proposed Solution

Develop a Chrome extension for Tensor.trade that serves as an NFT liquidation platform. This extension will:

1. Enable instant exchange of any SOL-based NFT for any SPL token at the best available market price.
2. Utilize Tensor.trade as the NFT marketplace aggregator to ensure optimal SOL prices for NFT sales.
3. Integrate Jupiter as the swap aggregator to convert SOL to any desired token at competitive rates.

### Key Components

1. **Tensor Integration**: Use Tensor's advanced NFT trading features, including real-time data analytics and optimal pricing algorithms.
2. **Jupiter API Integration**: Utilize Jupiter's pricing and swap APIs to execute efficient token conversions.

### Detailed User Flow

1. User installs the Chrome extension and navigates to Tensor.trade.
2. User clicks the 'swap' button in the extension.
3. Extension prompts user to connect their Solana wallet.
4. User selects the NFT they wish to liquidate from their connected wallet.
5. User chooses the desired output token (e.g., USDC, USDT, or any other SPL token).
6. Extension queries Tensor for the best SOL price for the selected NFT.
7. Simultaneously, the extension uses Jupiter's API to find the best swap rate from SOL to the chosen token.
8. User is presented with a summary of the transaction, including estimated output amount and fees.
9. Upon user confirmation, the extension executes the NFT sale on Tensor and immediately swaps the received SOL for the desired token using Jupiter.
10. User receives the final amount in their chosen token.

### Benefits

1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: Provides NFT holders with a quick way to access liquidity in their preferred tokens.
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Simplifies the process of selling NFTs for SOL and then converting back to stablecoins or other tokens, making it accessible to a broader audience.
3. **Optimal Pricing**: By leveraging aggregators, ensures users receive the best possible value for their NFTs.
4. **Time Efficiency**: Automates a process that would otherwise require multiple manual steps across different platforms.
5. **Market Expansion**: Potentially attracts more users to the Solana NFT ecosystem by offering flexible liquidation options.

### Technical Considerations

1. **Program Interaction**: Develop secure methods to interact with Solana's Program for NFT transactions.
2. **Gas Fee Optimization**: Implement strategies to minimize transaction fees on both NFT sales and token swaps.
3. **Slippage Protection**: Include mechanisms to protect users from significant price slippage during the liquidation process.
4. **Real-time Price Updates**: Ensure the extension provides up-to-date pricing information to users before they commit to a transaction.

### Next Steps

1. Create a detailed technical specification document.
2. Design user interface mockups for the Chrome extension.
3. Develop a prototype integrating Tensor and Jupiter APIs.
4. Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing.
5. Beta test with a small group of users to gather feedback.
6. Refine the extension based on user feedback and testing results.
7. Prepare for Chrome Web Store submission and launch.
